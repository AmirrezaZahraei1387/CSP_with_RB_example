# CSP_with_RB_example
Constraint satisfaction problem using random binary generator model

## Goal
The goal of this program was to make a simple constraint satisfaction
problem solver using various methods and options plus implementing the RB
model for random generating ofCSP. We mainly use the Backtracking search algorithm with option of using optimizations full look ahead and
forward-checking. The model is implemented to purely use binary constraints.

## Compilation and Execution
To run the program please run the main.py in the same folder as 
it is with other packages.

in linux
```cmd
python3 main.py
```

in windows
```cmd
python main.py
```

If you want to use the CSPInst package for your internal
use you can install it with the "setup.py" provided.
